null_resource.k8s_controller_bootstrap[0] (remote-exec): Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

null_resource.k8s_controller_bootstrap[0] (remote-exec): To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

null_resource.k8s_controller_bootstrap[0] (remote-exec):   sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

null_resource.k8s_controller_bootstrap[0] (remote-exec): Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

null_resource.k8s_controller_bootstrap[0] (remote-exec):   export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

null_resource.k8s_controller_bootstrap[0] (remote-exec): You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
